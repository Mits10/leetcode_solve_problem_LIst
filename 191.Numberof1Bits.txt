Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 
'1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Answer :

/**
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i=0; i<32; i++){
        if(n & 1 === 1){
            count++;
        }
         n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
};
